The Accessibility Tree: A Training Guide for Advanced Web Development
========

The purpose of the ARIA spec is to map simulated web controls to equivalent control types on the platform Accessibility API, and to provide various mechanisms to enhance the accessibility of web technologies. 

Operating System vendors, browser vendors, and Assistive Technology vendors, then follow the ARIA spec to ensure that control mappings are supported properly in each. 

It's important to understand that all ARIA Roles and supporting States and Properties map to their equivalent Roles, States and Properties within the Accessibility API on that Operating System, which is why the same ARIA markup when correctly implemented is valid across all devices and platforms.  

The Accessibility Tree Training Guide provides an in depth overview of all relevant information that is important to be aware of when building ARIA enhanced web technologies.
